# JAX Practice
A personal rework of [JAX official tutorials](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/beginner_guide.html#beginner-guide).  

## Prerequisites
I wrote these notebooks in Python 3.9.16 on an M1 chipset. 
These are the packages you definitely need. 
- numpy
- jupyterlab (`conda install jupyterlab`)
- matplotlib
- JAX (`conda install -c conda-forge jax`)
